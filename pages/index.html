          Currents is the third studio album by Australian musical project Tame
          Impala. It was released on 17 July 2015 by Modular Recordings and
          Universal Music Australia. In the United States it was released by
          Interscope Records and Fiction Records in the UK, while Caroline
          International released it in other regions. Like the project's
          previous two albums, Currents was written, recorded, performed, and
          produced by Kevin Parker. For the first time, Parker mixed the music
          and recorded all instruments by himself; the album featured no other
          collaborators.

          Saturday Night Wrist is the fifth studio album by American alternative
          metal band Deftones, released on October 31, 2006, by Maverick
          Records. Despite early contributions that were later scrapped, it
          marked the departure of mainstay Deftones producer Terry Date. It was
          also the last Deftones album to feature bassist Chi Cheng, as well as
          the last album of his career and his lifetime, prior to being involved
          in a serious car accident in 2008, which put him in a coma. He
          eventually died five years later from cardiac arrest.
